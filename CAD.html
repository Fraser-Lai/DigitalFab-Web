  <p>Use Fusion 360 to sketch and design the 3D printing object.</p>
  <h3>Keychain</h3>
  <p>How to 3D print your own personalize keychain?.</P>
  <p>Have your own personalize keychain design in Fusion 360</p>
  <p>Go to the file icon and select 3D print</P>
  <p>In this case I am using the school 3D printer (cura 2+). Therefore I have to download the app inorder to save the file.</p>
  <p>When the file is opened in cura 2+, you need to customize the setting; such as select the printer to cura 2+, matrial used is PLA etc.<p>
  <p>After you have done customizing the printer, select slice. It will estimate the time to print. Save your file in a SD card and insert it in the printer.</p>
  <p>At the beginning, you have to ensure that the 3D printer prints normally. If the 3D printer function normally, you can leave to do other work and come back when it is done.</p>
